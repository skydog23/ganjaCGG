In previous notebooks: 
we've introduced the notion of dual euclidean geometry, 
looked at the difference between $d$-circles and $e$-circles, 
explored the polarity on a non-degenerate conic section and 
the involutions it induces in line pencils, and 
shown how to characterize the focal point of a conic section in terms of these involutions.  

We now turn to apply what we've learned to the planetary orbits.

## Planetary orbits

Recall Kepler's Second Law of planetary motion:

We have shown above that at the focal point
