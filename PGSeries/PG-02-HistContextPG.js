**Touch and sight** It may be helpful to understand the transition from euclidean geometry to projective geometry by 
considering the role of the human senses.  Euclidean geometry, the geometry of measurement, is closely related to the sense of touch. This is revealed in the numerous units of length originally based on the human body, for example, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human-based_units_of_measurement" target=_blank>this Wikipedia article</a>. Measuring originally meant comparing the world with the human body via the sense of touch, and euclidean geometry is the mathematical fruit of this activity. 

Projective geometry on the other hand arose out of perspective painting. Artists, seeing that parallel lines intersect, began to
paint them.  Projective geometry is the mathematical fruit of this activity. 

At the same time as projective geometry was born, modern natural science was born through the work of Kepler, Galilei, Newton, and others. This led to a theory of knowledge, that distinguished between *primary* and *secondary* sense qualities, whereby 1) objective knowledge is based on primary sense qualities, and 2) primary sense qualities are those derived from the sense of touch. As the name implies, secondary sense perceptions are to be understood in terms of the primary ones. See, for example, John Locke's **An Essay on Human Understanding** (1690).

Thus, a dramatic situation arose. A new geometry that recognized the independent validity of visual perception came into being at exactly the same time that a new science was being established based on the deification of a single sense, the sense of touch.  This helps to explain why projective geometry has until now had a limited influence on the development of modern science.

There are however signs that projective geometry may yet play a role in overcoming the dogma of primary sense qualities and put modern science on a broader foundation that takes every sense on its own terms and does not *a priori* favor any as has been the case since Newton.
